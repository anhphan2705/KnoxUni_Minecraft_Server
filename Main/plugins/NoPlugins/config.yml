# NoPlugins
# Version: 7.2
# Developer(s): [Xanium]
# Main configuration file. 
# 
# Copyrighted under (All Rights Reserved)!
# 
# The first setting 'enable-tab-blocker' is where you can decide if you want to use it or not.
# You must add all commands that you want to remove from the command list when typing '/'
# 
# Then you have the single line messages that pop up when you type /plugins or so. These can you edit as much as you'd like.
# 
# Now you have the custom commands section, where you can enable or disable it, and add or remove commands to it's list.
# 
# Now you have the multi line messages section. Here can you add as many messages as you want to the existing lists.
# It is not recommended to disable the updater for this plugin due to the reason that new updates will patch bugs that most likely are critical. 
# If you don't notice the update you won't have 100% protection. You can always see the console for updates, if you have disabled update notifications ingame.
