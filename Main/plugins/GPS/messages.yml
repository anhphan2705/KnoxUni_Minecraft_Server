# This is the Message file for all GPS messages.
# 
# All messages are fully customizable and support color codes, formatting and ASCII symbols.
# Set the Prefix/ConfPrefix and use %prefix%/%confPrefix% to add the corresponding prefix to a message.
# Prepend any message with <ActionBar> to send it as an ActionBar message.
# Leave a message blank ('') to disable it.
# 
# You can also create messages with Hover and Click events. Syntax options: (Space between comma and quote is NOT allowed)
#  - ["Message","/Command"]
#  - ["Message","Hover"]
#  - ["Message","/Command","Hover"]
#  - ["Message","/Command","Suggest"]
#  - ["Message","/Command","Hover","Suggest"]
# You can add as many events to a message as you want. Example:
# '%prefix% &cInvalid arguments! ["&c&n&oHelp","/gps help","&aClick to get help!"]'
# The "Suggest" tag is used if the click event should suggest the command. Default is Run.
